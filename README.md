### About myself

Hi, as you can see on the title, I am a student at BeCode but before that I was also a student but in a completely other field : **Aviation**. Due to covid I had to stop it and I will come back to it later.

But in the meantime I wanted to challenge myself and I discover an all new world: Code. And I fell for it and hope to become a web developer after this program. So here I am coding my first markdown page.

### Objectives and Fears

|Being | Not having|
|:----------|:----------|
|Job ready |Enough skillset|
|Confident |Trust on myself|
|Within a helpful community|The knowledge to choose which path to take|


### Who I am?

I am :
1. Passionate
2. A hard worker
3. altruistic

I like:
1. Flying
2. Cooking
3. Learning (coding ðŸ˜‰)
4. Hanging out

My value and what I expect from others:
* Altruism
* Honesty
* Willingness


### What I look forward to?

Understand and Doing this. 

    (function(root) {
    
      'use strict';
    
      var cosh = function(x) {
        return (Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5;
      };
    
      var sinh = function(x) {
        return (Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5;
      };
     var cosm1 = function(x) {
        var limit = Math.PI/4;
        if (x < -limit || x > limit) {
          return (Math.cos(x) - 1.0);
        } ETC...


But I am sure that my coach will be able to help me ðŸ™ƒ
