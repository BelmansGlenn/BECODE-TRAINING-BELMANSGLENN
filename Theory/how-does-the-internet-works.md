# How The Internet Works

The internet is a wire and two server connected to the wire can communicate. Web page is the files on that server hardrive. Every server, router and our computer (clients) have an IP address to be able to trace and retrace the path that it takes to get the demand of the client and get it back for him.
When informations travel through the internet, the internet breaks the information in smaller pieces called "packets". When the information reach his final destination, it reassamble and the client can see the information in the original form.
